# Contributing to Toronto JS blog

We welcome contributions to the Toronto JS blog! If you would like to contribute, clone this repo, create a branch and then submit a pull request.

## Creating a branch

To create a branch, run the following command:

```shell
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

Replace `<branch-name>` with a descriptive name for your branch. We recommend using the following naming convention for your branch: `feature/<feature-name>` or `fix/<issue-name>`. that way it's easier to understand what the branch is about.

Add a descriptive name to your feature/fix, so it's easier to understand what the branch is about. For example, if you are adding a list of posts to the blog, you could name your branch `feature/add-posts-list`. If you are fixing a bug with the navbar CSS, you could name your branch `fix/issue-123` or `fix/navbar-css`.

## Submitting a pull request

Once you have made your changes, push your branch to the remote repository and submit a pull request. We will review your changes and merge them into the main branch if they are approved.
