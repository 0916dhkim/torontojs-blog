	<p>This site is made for people. As such we try my best to be AA compliant with <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</a> and by doing that try to make the web more accessible and inclusive.</p>

	<p>That said, we are not perfect andby being a voluntary community, we are always improving the website.</p>
	<p>We run automated testing for accessibility issues regularly, as well as testing on desktop and mobile browsers with different zoom levels.</p>

	<p>If you have any issues with the site, please contact me at <em><a href="mailto:volunteers@torontojs.com">volunteers@torontojs.com</a></em>.</p>

	<p>If you have the technical knowledge, feel free to open an issue <a href="https://github.com/torontojs/blog/issues/new">on GitHub</a>.</p>
